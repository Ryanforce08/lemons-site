				<h2>LEGO NIGHT</h2>
				<p>LEGO Night is an annual event held by the Combustible Lemons. During LEGO
					Night, we invite kids from the 3rd to 7th grade to a LEGO Building
					Competition. The kids have to make creations that fulfill different tasks
					related to the night's theme, with every year having a different theme.
					Additional to the LEGO Building Competition, we have presentations and
					tables to give information about FIRST Programs in our town, and invite
					local FLL teams to demonstrate their robots alongside our own.</p>

				<div class="section">
					<h2>MOORESTOWN DAY / AUTUMN IN MOORESTOWN</h2>
					<p>Every year, our town hosts "Moorestown Day" and "Autumn in Moorestown,"
						events in which our main street is shut down and filled with booths for
						stores, organizations, and restaurants. Our team has held a booth at these
						events for the past four years, showing off our robot to our community. We
						offer the ability to drive the robot to kids, and offer face painting.</p>

				<div class="section">
					<h2>FLL SCRIMMAGE/QUALIFIER</h2>
					<p>In 2015, the Combustible Lemons hosted an unofficial FLL scrimmage for
						preparation for their upcoming qualifier events. In 2016, we hosted an
						official FLL qualifier for South Jersey teams, additionally offering games
						made by the Lemons related to the Animal Allies theme.</p>
